//! plan-20260921 GC-VG-01 / VG-03 G8 (`passphrase_and_plaintext_buffers_are_zeroized`):
//! the GPG passphrase (and the intermediate plaintext key material) must be
//! wiped before their heap blocks are released.
//!
//! Rather than trusting a type annotation, this target installs a scanning
//! global allocator: while the needle is armed, every `dealloc` compares the
//! freed bytes against the passphrase and counts a violation when they are
//! still present. The test arms the scanner, runs the real CLI in-process (so
//! the production passphrase reader is exercised on this heap), and asserts
//! that no freed block ever carried the passphrase.
//!
//! A calibration step first frees a copy *without* wiping it and requires the
//! scanner to notice, so a silently broken detector cannot pass the test.
