//! Per-turn coverage claim gate (plan-20260713 DR-05c-0, ADR-DR-09/10/16).
//!
//! `agent_coverage_claim` is the WRITE-FRONT idempotence gate: a checkpoint
//! writer reserves the logical turns it is about to cover *before* building
//! objects, and commits the claims (revision insert + claim advance + catalog
//! row) inside the SAME SQLite transaction as the traces ref CAS — so a
//! repeated TurnEnd, a crash retry, or a concurrent writer can never produce
//! a second visible checkpoint for an already-covered turn.
//!
//! Arbitration (ADR-DR-09) is embodied in [`reserve_live_turn_claims`]:
//! equivalent committed content → no-op; committed `incomplete` upgraded by
//! new `complete` content → revision advance; committed `complete` vs a
//! different `complete` digest → `conflicted` (doctor's job, never silent
//! overwrite); an unexpired foreign reservation → skip (someone else is
//! writing this turn); an expired one → fenced takeover. Every mutation is a
//! conditional write checked via `rows_affected == 1` — losers re-read, they
//! never assume.
//!
//! Failure policy (ADR-DR-10): any DB error here fails the checkpoint write
//! *closed* — the caller must not append to `refs/libra/traces` without a
//! reservation, and a commit-time fence mismatch rolls the whole final
//! transaction back (ref update included). A transient SQLite writer-lock
//! race is reported as an in-flight skip so the caller emits the same
//! replayable diagnostic as an explicit foreign reservation.
